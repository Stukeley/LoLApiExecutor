Simple tool for executing API requests for the League of Legends Client.

# Why?
Some time ago, I tried using Rift Explorer to change my status message, but it stopped working when the League Client Update was released.

Instead, I used a different tool, but I forgot its name and I just couldn't find it again.

So, I decided to create my own tool for this purpose.

# Planned projects

1. Console Application
2. WPF
3. ASP.NET?
